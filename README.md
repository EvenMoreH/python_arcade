# python_arcade

Status: Suspended / Archived

I parked this Python Arcade prototype because the journey pivoted: the game is now being reborn in Lua (embracing lean runtime + scripting vibe). This repo stays as a minimal snapshot of an early movable‑dot concept.

Why the pivot:
- Wanted tighter iteration with a lightweight runtime.
- Lua’s embedding + hot-reload simplicity won.
- Future experiments will live in the Lua-based repo (not here).

What remains here:
- Bare starter idea (was going to grow into scenes, assets, systems).
- Useful only as a reference for an initial Arcade window + input loop (not maintained).

Next steps (elsewhere):
- Reimplement core loop in Lua.
- Add entity update + draw pipeline.
- Layer input mapping + simple ECS.

No further updates planned here. Enjoy the fossil.
